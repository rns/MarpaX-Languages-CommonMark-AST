MarpaX-Languages-CommonMark-AST
===============================

BNF-based implementation of spec.commonmark.org using Marpa::R2, now at its inception. The initial plan is to get basic tests in most spec sections pass thus producing a preliminary verson of the single grammar used for both specification and (mostly) syntax-driven (aka declarative) parsing.
